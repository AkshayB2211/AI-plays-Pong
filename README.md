# AI-plays-Pong
Classic pong game is developed using pygame and played by two AI agents competing each other.

## Requirements
Python along with libraries pygame, matplotlib, numpy.

### Training process never ends....
This uses Q-learning to train two agents to play pong against each other.
Best Q-table is inside '/qtables/best_ones/' ... but not best yet.
Next step will be to use deep Q-learning (DQN).

Run 'qlearning_pong.py' to see the agents play....
Training can be done using same code by disabling "PLAY" flag in the code.
